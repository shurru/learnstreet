Welcome! Here is a ROT-13 project I built on LearnStreet's Code Garage using python.
===============================================================================================================

Project description
-------------------------

In this project you will write the code to encrypt and decrypt with ROT-13. ROT-13 is a simple substitution cypher. It stands for <code>"ROTate by 13 places."</code> Thus the cypher replaces any letter with the one that appears 13 sequential places behind it.

Try it out!
